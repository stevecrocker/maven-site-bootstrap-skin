# Maven Site Bootstrap Skin

This is a skin to be used by the maven-site-plugin, the default skin uses legacy versions of jQuery and embed a number of older Apache Images. The goal of this skin is to provide a Modern Bootstrap 5 wrapping of the Maven Site, allowing you to configure various aspects to better tailor the layout to your desired layout.

It allows you to supply a [Bootswatch Theme](https://bootswatch.com/) as a CSS file as well as other additional CSS. 

## Default Example

If you don't set any of the options, the above image is the default generated by the skin.

I've modified the custom setting to show how the resulting site can be better tailored to your layout needs.
